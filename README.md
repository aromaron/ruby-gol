# ruby-gol

This is an approach to solve the `Conway's Game of life` in Ruby. For this excercise, with a time window frame, I focused on the logic of the game, thus I'm using TDD trying to solve all cases and to apply all rules, meaning this game is not 'playable' in any graphic way.

You will be need Rspec in order to run the tests:

`rspec ruby_gol_spec.rb`
